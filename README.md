1.  Write a Menu-driven C Program to achieve the following: -
1.1    Clear the graphics screen and accept pixel size and ratio (default 1x1)
1.2    Animate a (+: plus-like) cursor with a blank at the middle and 3 pixels on each extension
1.3    Accept two end point co-ordinates (within permissible limits) and draw a DDA line
1.4    Continue to draw a Bresenham Line between the same two points in a different colour
1.5    Accept permissible centre co-ordinates and radius to draw a circle using Algorithm 1.
1.6    Continue to draw the same circle in a different colour using Algorithm 2.
1.7    Plot an ellipse within screen limits with specified centre and minor and major axes.
1.8    Convert Circles to Ellipse and vice-versa using rectangular pixels.
1.9    Save plotted points in disk files and verify whether they change with: 
(a) Change In pixel size       (b) Change in algorithms used

2.  Write a C program to implement the classical -0 1 knapsack problem and Its fractional variant to pictorially represent the hauls in the form of a stacked bar chart. It should be able to compare results for N Items.
Note: - The width of the stacked bar should be GCD of the weight factors of the items.

3.  Implement the Huffman Code algorithm for n characters appearing within a text me with different frequencies. Generate the Greedy Tree with graphical representation of the growth of the tree, using rectangular modules for leaves and circular ones for internal nodes. Inscribe each node with the calculated weight at that point, preceded by the charact er value at the leaves.

4.  Draw a flower: At the centre there should be a circle Initially left arc of one of the petals need to be drawn as part of an ellipse, the right arc needs to be obtained through reflection. The complete petal then has to be redrawn at equal angular intervals by rotation to obtain a complete flower.

5.  Ripple A: Draw a complete horizontal wave at the beginning - the next ripple should be a scaled down version of the previous ripple - and that should continue till the magnitude diminishes to an Insignificant value.
Ripple B: The whole of ripple A needs to be reflected with respect to a central vertical axis.
Ripple C: Ripple 8 needs to be replicated downwards 5 times using translation.

6.  Kaleidoscope:  Draw the square bounding box - using a linear colour beam which starts at an arbitrary point on one of the four walls, get reflected on each of the remaining walls, till it goes out of bounds automatically or exceeds a predefined rebound limit Then the next beam starts with a new colour, and the process ends when all colours have been exhausted.
